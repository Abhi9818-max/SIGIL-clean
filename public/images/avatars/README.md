## Avatar Images

Place your avatar image files in this directory.

Name them sequentially like:
- `avatar-1.png`
- `avatar-2.png`
- `avatar-3.png`
- etc.

The Avatar Selection Dialog will automatically pick them up. Make sure they are `.png` files.

The current implementation is configured to load up to 12 avatars. You can change this number in `src/components/settings/AvatarSelectionDialog.tsx`.
